## Project Description {#project-description}
*Be as succinct as possible in this section*

This analysis aims to characterize approximately 25 years of shoreline profile transect data, provided by NANOOS (Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems).
Using this data combined with area expertise, the relevant coastal areas have been characterized and delineated into "reaches". 


## :droplet: Location in Herrera Database {#location-in-herrera-database}

The original, unmodified data used in this project is located in the "data_raw" folder within this repository.
That folder is backed up to TODO: Fill this in. Best to use O drive? Or SharePoint?

If you do not have access to the data, please contact the emails listed at the bottom of the repository.


## ðŸ“¦ Requirements and Dependencies {#requirements-and-dependencies}

Below is a list of packages and external softwares that this project utilizes. Please ensure you have the package(s) installed and have access to the tools listed below. TODO: This was something I involved in my previous READMEs, but might be more trouble than it's worth. Original table(s) included all packages required, and then a separate table for external data with its location, either URl or location on drive.

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
packages.table <- "
|Name          | Description           
|:-------------|:-------------|
|[`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) | Programming language used for this project. |
|[`NANOOS Profile Data`](https://nvs.nanoos.org/BeachMapping) | The raw data for analysis. If you do not have access to this data, please contact the owners of this repository.|
|[`Washington Coastal Erosion and Hazard Assessment`](https://waecy.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=389d0a3ce642485db912d4a416a56e25) | A second database used to compare the accuracy of NANOOS data.|

cat(packages.table)
```

## :computer: Installation and Usage {#installation-and-usage}

TODO: Installation tips will be helpful for libraries/packages, but not sure they need to be included in basic analysis scripts, especially for PMs. Suggestions for this section? It was suggested from Paul/Clark to include a "typical imports" section. A load_packages/import_packages script could be included in the template repository (that is the case for this analysis.)

In order to run this script and recreate the analysis, you will need to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer. All the data produced by this analysis can be found in the data_secondary/ folder, while all figures can be found in the figures/ directory.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Layout of directory and data

TODO: I think a general layout should be considered part of the repository template. 

This repository is organized into a main Complete.Rmd markdown script, which produces the results from scratch when run in its entirety. The Complete script references folders of raw data (data_raw/), and produces results data that has been modified or created by the analysis (data_secondary/). All analysis scripts are contained in the scripts/ directory, which also contains the src/ subdirectory. The src/ subdirectory contains package loading scripts and scripts that produce or modify data used throughout the analysis. 

The data_raw/ folder is **READ ONLY** and should never be modified or deleted.

### :heavy_check_mark: Detailed description of data and analysis

The raw data consists of approximately 4500 individual profiles across 54 coastal sites in Washington and Oregon, stretching from Moclips to Cape Disappointment.
The profiles are in x y z format (Easting Northing elevation). The naming convention is prof_X_ssYY.out where prof is short for profile, X is the profile number, ss is a season code (e.g. f = fall) and YY is the year, in the format of the last two digits (e.g. "98" is 1998", "00" is 2000, "08" is 2008, etc).

Throughout the course of the analysis, the Control script loads and tidies the raw profiles, creating a main csv of all profiles that contain data (see below for data discrepancies). Profiles are visualized and examined. Profiles are compared to an arbitrary "BasePoint" line set a reasonable distance inland, and the Euclidean distance between this BasePoint and each profile is calculated; over time, the increase and decrease in this Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for shoreline change (accretion or erosion). The rates of change are also calculated for each profile.

These profiles are also compared to the [Washington Coastal Erosion and Hazard Assessment](https://waecy.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=389d0a3ce642485db912d4a416a56e25).

Finally, profiles are clustered into subreaches using a combination of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and area knowledge. **Please be aware that the final csv of subreach characterization CANNOT be produced by this script, only the clustering that informed the final decision.**

The Complete.Rmd script contains comments and detailed description of each step.

### :information_source: Metadata {#metadata}

The vertical datum is NAVD88.
The horizontal is WA State Plane South.
All of the units are in meters.

### :exclamation: Data discrepancies {#data-discrepancies}

Quite a few profiles are null (empty) and have been removed and noted.
See the "Explore Profiles" section for more information.

A small portion of the profiles had non-conforming filenames: "BigE06", "beachface", etc.
These files do not represent a large percentage of the files and have not been included in the analysis.

Profiles 42 - 47 are in Oregon and have been excluded from most of the analysis.

*Geographically, profiles do not proceed sequentially.*
